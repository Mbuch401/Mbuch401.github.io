                Diving into my motor classification and anomaly detection project felt like stepping into a mechanical symphony,
                 where every hum and whir told a story. Using an ESP32 as the conductor, paired with the MAX9814 microphone,
                  I aimed to capture the subtle nuances of motor sounds to classify their states—full speed, half speed, and
                   idle—and detect anomalies that could spell trouble. Think of it as a mechanic with superhuman hearing, armed
                  with AI instead of a wrench.
            </p>
            <p>
                The journey began with collecting raw audio samples. Picture me crouched next to a motor, recording its full-speed roar,
                 its half-speed hum, and its idle purr, all with the precision of a sound engineer at a concert. The MAX9814, with its
                  built-in auto-gain control, became my trusty sidekick, ensuring clean audio signals. These samples weren’t just
                   recordings; they were data—golden nuggets to feed into a machine learning model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges revved up quickly. Storing the audio files as .wav formats on an SD card was no walk in the park, and let’s
                 just say debugging the setup was like trying to find a needle in a haystack with a blindfold. But step by step, I
                  pieced it together, turning sensor readings into valuable insights.

                Training the machine learning model added another layer of intrigue. By leveraging tools
                like Edge Impulse, I crafted a model that could classify motor states with impressive accuracy
                and flag anomalies—those ominous signs of wear and tear—before they became costly repairs.
                Each anomaly detected felt like catching a plot twist in a thriller before it unraveled.
            </p>
                <p>This project wasn’t just an exercise in engineering; it was a dance between hardware and software,
                     creativity and precision. With every successful classification and every detected anomaly, I wasn’t
                      just monitoring a motor—I was redefining what it means to listen to machines.</p>
